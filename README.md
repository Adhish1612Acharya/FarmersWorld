Inspiration
During a college project field visit, I met farmers who shared their struggles with government schemes. They were unaware of available schemes, faced issues with ghosted applications, and had difficulty tracking their application statuses. They also mentioned the complexity and redundancy in applying for schemes.

What it does
FarmersWorld offers a user-friendly platform for farmers to manage their applications for government schemes. By using Aadhaar numbers, Farmers' Unique IDs, and passport-sized photos, farmers can easily apply for schemes. The platform verifies their credentials, tracks application statuses, and prevents duplicate applications. Government officials can also use the site to view and process pending applications efficiently.

How I built it
I built FarmersWorld using the MERN stack with TypeScript and Material UI for a seamless user experience. The project leverages React-Redux Toolkit and MVC architecture for code readability and maintainability. Also used cloudinary for secure storage of images.

Challenges I ran into
One major challenge was optimizing the logic for tracking applications and providing accurate data. Ensuring a user-friendly UI/UX while maintaining efficient backend processes was another significant hurdle.

Accomplishments that I am proud of
We successfully implemented complex logic for application tracking, prevented duplicate applications, and ensured secure authorization for both farmers and admins.

What I learned
I learned to develop complex logic with optimal time complexity and maintain a large codebase efficiently

What's next for FarmersWorld
Next, plan is to add a review and complaint system for each scheme, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and connect with others facing similar issues. This feature aims to foster a supportive community among farmers.
